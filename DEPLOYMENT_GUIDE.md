# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment - Final Steps

## ✅ What's Already Done

- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow created (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- ✅ Vite configured with correct base path (`/Patiently/`)
- ✅ React Router configured with basename
- ✅ package.json updated with homepage URL
- ✅ All changes pushed to GitHub

---

## 📋 Required Steps in GitHub (Do This Now!)

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/Dev-KrishnaPathak/Patiently
2. Click **Settings** tab (top right)
3. Scroll down to **Pages** in the left sidebar
4. Under **Build and deployment**:
   - **Source**: Select `GitHub Actions` (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
5. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Enable Workflow Permissions

1. Still in **Settings**, go to **Actions** → **General** (left sidebar)
2. Scroll to **Workflow permissions**
3. Select: **Read and write permissions** ✅
4. Check: **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests** ✅
5. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Trigger Deployment

The workflow will automatically run when you push to `main`, but you can manually trigger it:

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click on **Deploy to GitHub Pages** workflow (left sidebar)
3. Click **Run workflow** button (right side)
4. Click green **Run workflow** button
5. Wait for deployment (~2-3 minutes)

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

Once the workflow succeeds (green checkmark ✅):

1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. You'll see: "Your site is live at https://dev-krishnapathak.github.io/Patiently/"
3. Click the URL or visit: **https://dev-krishnapathak.github.io/Patiently/**

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "404 - File not found"
**Solution**: Make sure you selected "GitHub Actions" as the source (not "Deploy from a branch")

### Issue: Workflow fails
**Solution**: 
1. Check if you enabled "Read and write permissions" in Actions settings
2. Look at the error in Actions tab
3. Common issues:
   - Missing `package-lock.json` → Run `npm install` in frontend folder locally and push
   - Permission denied → Enable workflow permissions (Step 2 above)

### Issue: Blank page after deployment
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the base path in `vite.config.js` is `/Patiently/`
3. Verify basename in `App.jsx` is `/Patiently`

### Issue: API not working
**Solution**: 
The frontend is deployed, but the backend needs separate deployment:
- Backend must be deployed to a service like Railway, Render, or Fly.io
- Update `API_BASE_URL` in `Dashboard.jsx` to your backend URL
- For now, the frontend will show the UI but uploads won't work without backend

## 🎯 What Works After Deployment

### ✅ Working:
- Landing page with all UI elements
- Navigation to Dashboard
- Responsive design
- All frontend features (UI only)

### ⚠️ Not Working (Needs Backend):
- File upload
- Document analysis
- AI-powered insights
- Health trends data

---

## 🔧 Next Steps for Full Functionality

To get the upload and analysis features working, deploy the backend:

### Option 1: Railway.app (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Deploy
cd backend
railway init
railway up
```

### Option 2: Render.com (Free Tier)
1. Go to https://render.com
2. New → Web Service
3. Connect GitHub repository
4. Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Start Command: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
6. Add environment variable: `CEREBRAS_API_KEY`

### Option 3: Fly.io
```bash
# Install Fly CLI
# Deploy
cd backend
fly launch
fly deploy
```

### Update Frontend API URL
After deploying backend, update in `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-backend-url.com/api';
```

Then push changes:
```bash
git add frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx
git commit -m "Update API URL for production backend"
git push origin main
```
