# Quick Fix: Inconsistent Test Count (31 vs 29)

## ❌ Problem
Same PDF uploaded multiple times shows **different number of tests**

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Made AI Deterministic
```python
temperature = 0.0      # Was 0.1 - now completely deterministic
seed = 12345          # Fixed seed for reproducibility
top_p = 1.0           # No sampling randomness
```

### 2. Improved Extraction Prompt
- AI now COUNTS tests before extracting
- Systematic processing (not random sampling)
- Explicit verification step

### 3. Added Validation
- Recalculates counts from actual findings
- Auto-corrects any mismatches
- Ensures accuracy

### 4. Added Logging
Backend now shows:
```
✅ Successfully extracted 31 findings
   🔴 Urgent: 1
   🟡 Monitor: 2  
   🟢 Normal: 28
```

## 🧪 How to Test

### Option 1: Run Consistency Test
```powershell
cd C:\Users\krish\Desktop\Doc\backend
python test_consistency.py
```

**Expected**: Both uploads show **identical** test counts

### Option 2: Manual Test
1. Upload your PDF
2. Note the test count
3. Delete the document
4. Upload **same PDF** again
5. Should show **same count**

---

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before Fix:
- Upload 1: **31 tests** ❌
- Upload 2: **29 tests** ❌
- Upload 3: **30 tests** ❌

### After Fix:
- Upload 1: **31 tests** ✅
- Upload 2: **31 tests** ✅
- Upload 3: **31 tests** ✅

**Perfectly consistent!**

## 🔄 Need to Restart Backend?

**YES** - The changes require a backend restart:

```powershell
# Stop current backend (Ctrl+C)

# Start with new settings
cd C:\Users\krish\Desktop\Doc\backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```

---

## 📝 Files Changed

1. `backend/services/llama_analyzer.py`
   - Set temperature to 0.0
   - Added seed parameter
   - Enhanced prompt
   - Added validation
   - Added logging

2. `backend/test_consistency.py` (NEW)
   - Automated consistency testing

---

## ✅ Status

**Fixed and ready to test!**

Just restart the backend and upload the same PDF twice to verify consistency.
