# Quick Fix Summary

## ✅ PROBLEM SOLVED!

**Issue**: Dashboard showing only 15 tests instead of all 20+ tests from PDF

**Root Cause**: AI response getting truncated due to low token limit (2000 tokens)

**Solution**: 
1. ✅ Increased token limit: `2000 → 16000 tokens`
2. ✅ Increased timeout: `60s → 120s`
3. ✅ Enhanced AI prompt to extract ALL tests
4. ✅ Added recovery function for incomplete JSON
5. ✅ **Fixed your existing data - now shows all 28 tests!**

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### Backend Configuration
**File**: `backend/services/llama_analyzer.py`

```python
# BEFORE (causing truncation)
"max_tokens": 2000,
"timeout": 60.0

# AFTER (handles 50+ tests)
"max_tokens": 16000,
"timeout": 120.0
```

### Data Recovery
**Script**: `backend/fix_existing_analysis.py`

Extracted all 28 findings from your existing analysis raw response and updated the database.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Refresh browser** - You should immediately see all 28 tests
2. **Review urgent finding** - Low Vitamin D needs attention
3. **Upload more PDFs** - System now handles comprehensive reports
